# Real vs Fake Image Classification using CNN and VGG NET

This project was developed as a DSAI division project at OmahTI with my friend named  [@azbagas] (https://www.github.com/azbagas). The goal is to classify real and fake images from the CIFAKE dataset. 

## Project Overview

The primary aim of this project is to build a robust system for distinguishing between real and fake images. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and VGG-Net architecture, the system aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying images.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the images before feeding them into the models for training and testing.
- **Modeling**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The models, CNN and VGG NET, are trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy (ACC), precision (prec), recall (rec), F1-score (f1), and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC).

### Technologies Used

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A deep learning model commonly used for image classification tasks.
- **VGG-Net**: A deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image recognition.
